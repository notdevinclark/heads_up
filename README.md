# HeadsUp
This application is the product of following exercises from the [Pragmatic
Studios](https://pragmaticstudio.com)'s [Full Stack Phoenix Course](https://pragmaticstudio.com/courses/phoenix). 
I also tried to add my own twist to it in places so that it wouldn't be an exact
one for one of the results of following the exercises.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
